Description of dataset:
A dataset of 37 men and 30 women (tested in the luteal phase of their menstrual cycle) participated in a public speaking task to induce social-evaluative threat. Responses of multiple stress systems were measured (trait appraisal, sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system activity, self-reported motivation and affect, and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis activity), as well as personality traits (e.g. neuroticism and extraversion).

Description of analyses:
File '01_CalculationOfData.R' imports the data, calculates new variables, and imputes missing data.
File '02_AnalysisOfImputedData.R' calculates descriptive statistics, and tests hypotheses using t-tests, Bayesian statistics, and multiple lineair regressions. Plots are also created.
